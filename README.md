# Student Feedback System
# About
This was one of the project done by a group of mine, each tasked on different section such as registration, login etc.
I, was tasked to focus on the staff side (Front and backend) and started to use ajax within my code cause I prefer site not to yeet me to another page

Students also will be able to view and answer the questions per feedback which will be viewed back by the lecturers when the due date of the feedback met specific time.
